# Space-Impact-Reborn-CS233-Project
A space shooter game implemented on 8x8 Led Dot Matrix using System Verilog HDL  
For underclassmen: DO NOT TRY TO STEAL THE LED CODE!   
It's a part of your education, you will learn a lot from trying to write it yourself.  
This will make sure you don't cry at the end of semester about not knowing how to write a sinle line of System Verilog code.
